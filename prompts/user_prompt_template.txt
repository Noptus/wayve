For the past {window_description}, we collected the following items from curated finance and private-markets feeds. Assume the audience already read Bloomberg's top stories; surface differentiated signals, primary research, and tactical insights.

Return JSON exactly matching the agreed schema. Populate:
- "highlights" with crisp 8-14 word phrases (no ending punctuation) that spotlight the most differentiated angles (3-6 entries).
- For each item, craft summary/market_impact/action that build on the supplied details without repeating the headline verbatim.
- Keep the output order identical to the feed order you receive. If fewer than 10 items are supplied, return the same number.
